DPM-delta
Version 1.0
===========

Discriminative Pattern Mining (DPM) is an algorithm to simultaneously
miner generators and close patterns of frequent equivalence classes.
The transactions can have multiple class labels.

Usage:
	DPM-delta data_filename \
		 #classes min_sup(an obsolute number) \
		 delta(a small integer) [output_filename]


Data format is similar to FIMI workshop:

Each line represents an object with a set of attributes (integers) 
separated by space.  The first column contains class labels.
